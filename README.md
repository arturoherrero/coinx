# CoinX

Client to work with different Bitcoin Exchanges.

## TODO

- [x] Define project
- [ ] Compile LibECP library automatically
- [x] Execute a WS call to the API without authentication
- [x] Subsribe to an event without authentication like watchOrders
- [ ] Execute a WS call to the API with authentication
- [ ] Subscribe to an event with authentication like getBalances
- [ ] Establish an architecture that allows to work with different exchange implementations
- [ ] Create a CoinX client that subscribes to a topic setting a closure that is going to be called as a callback when an event occurs 

## TASKS

- validations, feedback & refactors
- do not use `require_relative` in the specs
- review event factory specs since probably there is a better way to test that with rspec
- review specific stubs created for coinfloor client specs since probably there is a better way to test that with rspec
- proper dependency injection mechanism, do not call new inside a constructor
- move scheduler_spec to an integration directory, since itâ€™s not a unit test and hence slow
- create unit-spec & integration-spec runners
- end to end tests + VCR

## IMPROVEMENTS

- [ ] Use non blocking calls
- [ ] scheduler can be re-initialized every time there is a websocket communication

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Develop the trading algorithm as a separate project
